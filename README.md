## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I had a great time building this solution. I found that it was enough to test myself, but not too much to break me. I was able to confidently build the layout and match the design as close as possible.

My only thing I wasn't able to get right was the squiggle on the email notfication section. But overall I thoroughly enjoyed this project.
